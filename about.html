								<h2>History</h2>
								<p>Established as the Geoscience Student Society, NMGS UNILAG underwent a pivotal transformation in 2022, rebranding itself to reflect its affiliation with the Nigerian Mining and Geosciences Society. Serving as the premier geoscience body within the University of Lagos, its leadership comprises student executives elected by the Department. Embracing tradition, NMGS UNILAG hosts a myriad of annual events including Freshers' Orientation, HOD Games, and Career Day, fostering a vibrant community dedicated to academic excellence and professional development within the geosciences field.</p>
								<h2>Objectives</h2>
								<p>The current NMGS UNILAG administration is dedicated to empowering our fellow geoscience students on three key fronts: academic excellence, future-ready skills, and a strong sense of community.
									<ul>
									<li><b>Academic Achievement:</b> We recognize the importance of a solid foundation. We'll offer targeted <b>tutorials and support programs</b> to help students excel in their coursework. </li>
									
									<li><b>Future-Proofing Your Skills:</b> The industry demands well-rounded professionals. We'll organize <b>technical and career sessions</b>, along with <b>industrial visits and training programs</b>, to equip you with the skills employers seek.</li>
									
									<li><b>Building a Supportive Community:</b>We believe a strong network fosters success. We'll continue our tradition of <b>games, sports, and social events</b> to create a vibrant and supportive community where you can connect with peers and faculty.</li>
								</ul>
									NMGS UNILAG is committed to your academic and professional success. We'll work tirelessly to provide the resources and environment you need to thrive as a geoscientist.
									</p>
								<h2>Achievements</h2>
								<p>Successful freshmen onboarding, promotion of camaraderie through games activitie and organisation of syudents and varieties night during the NMGS-NAPE mini conference, all highlight the impact of teamwork and leadership within the organization. A well-organized freshmen onboarding program requires clear communication, collaboration between committee members, and strong leadership to ensure a smooth transition for new students. Engaging games nights and conference varieties nights also necessitate teamwork in planning, execution, and creating a welcoming atmosphere. These achievements point to a dedicated NMGS UNILAG team working effectively under strong leadership to benefit all members.</p>
